1. Imported all the libraries - Start by importing the necessary libraries. These libraries are essential for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

2. shape, head, info, describe-Load the dataset and perform basic data checks to understand its structure and content.

3. made boxplot for all the individuals column to detect outliers - Create boxplots to visualize outliers in the dataset.

4. removed outliers using IQR method(as data is not normally distributed) - Remove outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

5. done pandas profiling for different graphs-Generate a pandas profiling report to get an in-depth analysis of the dataset.

6. Train test split - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

7. model fitting - Fit a Linear Regression model to the training data.

8. calculated coefficients and bias - Extract the coefficients and the intercept (bias) from the trained model.

9. calculated r2 score - Evaluate the model's performance using the R-squared metric.

10. cross validated - Perform cross-validation to further evaluate the model's performance.
